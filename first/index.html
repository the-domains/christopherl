<p>As a man once said, the waiting is the hardest part. Short of signing up for a service like Medium, Tumblr, or Blogger (is that still a thing? really? no way?) you'd be hard pressed to find an easier way to get your own website up and running. After clicking the link in my welcome email I was invited to sign in using an existing account (the usual suspects are supported: Facebook, Twitter, Google & Github) and I was off to the races. Creating a new site is as easy as a few clicks and filling in a few details, all right in my browser. There's even foolproof <a href="http://help.thegrid.io/article/58-custom-domain">instructions for using a custom domain</a>, just like this one, that are so simple even your mom could follow them. </p><p>Incidentally, in the event your mom doesn't have a website, get her a <a href="http://www.hooli.xyz/">.xyz</a>. She's earned it - you were a difficult child.</p><h2>Design</h2><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/da3ad343-6b10-47b7-8a49-00eef5c98e03.png"><p>For my money this is probably the least compelling thing about using the grid thus far. The <a href="http://gridtalk.info/thread/33/rhythmic-contrast">controls are simple to use, but confusing</a>, and despite my best effort the results are a website that looks like it was designed by a programmer. While it is far easier to click and drag a slider then craft artful CSS, the limiting results are lackluster. The most confusing part for me as a grid user is how good the grid's homepage looks. I assume at this point it's user error on my part, because as I understand it <a href="https://thegrid.io/">the grid's homepage</a> is built on the same platform users have access to.</p><h2>Publishing</h2><picture>

<p>Writing on the grid has <a href="http://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/9-minimal-word-processor-apps-for-distraction-free-writ-1730016034">a "distraction free" feel</a> that has become so popular. Unfortunately there is no advanced mode, or toolbar - controls are contextual, so when crafting an update for your site there is a bit of a learning curve as you hunt to find which combination of clicks and highlighting expose the options you're looking for. Once triggered the formatting options available are mostly sufficient, but strangely limited. For example, highlighting text displays the menu to add a link (shown in the image above) but highlighting an existing link doesn't provide a way to edit it, you can only remove the link by clicking the same link button. You can preview the link by right clicking on it, but it's not readily apparent within the UI - I stumbled on it by accident. There's also no underline, strikethrough, indentation, link target or other common options found in many CMS editors.</p><p>Adding images to your post couldn't be much easier - just look at all of them in this post! The only downside is that you have to upload the images to add them. There's no option for using an existing URL, which would be more convenient when using photos you've already uploaded elsewhere.</p><p>There's also no ability to preview posts, or unpublish a post once it's live. Even though the grid controls site layout through the slider settings, and the post editor only controls content, it would still be nice to have the ability to preview a post before it becomes public on my site - even though my ability to adjust it within the editor is limited.</p><h2>Cost</h2><p>My founding membership cost $96 and provides beta access along with one year of subscription when the beta is complete. This makes the grid comparable to similar website builder services from WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, Weebly, etc. <a href="https://thegrid.io/faq/">Founding members also get a few additional perks</a>, which I look forward to receiving - the NFC token seems like fun, even if it is a bit impractical.</p><p>Reviewing the FAQ it appears regular price for the grid is $25 a month - though founding members will be able to renew at their original $8 a month rate after their first year concludes.</p><h2>Bonuses</h2><p>A <a href="http://mandrillapp.com/track/click/30128911/chrome.google.com?p=eyJzIjoicXBsR1R3WVNDc2tZelhmaTVtdG5jNGdYd1BNIiwidiI6MSwicCI6IntcInVcIjozMDEyODkxMSxcInZcIjoxLFwidXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2Nocm9tZS5nb29nbGUuY29tXFxcL3dlYnN0b3JlXFxcL2RldGFpbFxcXC90aGUtZ3JpZFxcXC9wcHBqa2ZlanBiY29wa2lpbm5pY2hsb2FhamRwcG1sb1wiLFwiaWRcIjpcImY5NmMwM2JkNGJjMjRiZTNhMDQ5NGQ1MjE3MDIxODBhXCIsXCJ1cmxfaWRzXCI6W1wiZGFiMGIzNzRmYTkzMjQyMTM3Mjk3ZmFjNzk2NDZlN2UxNWFkMzMyMVwiXX0ifQ">Google Chrome extension</a> saves you the trouble of having to click a bookmark to get to <a href="https://app.thegrid.io/">the grid's webapp</a> and also allows right click sharing of webpages as posts on your grid powered site.</p><picture>

<p>Apps are available for both iOS and Android, though the iOS version appears to be a work in progress. While it offers sharing capabilities similar to the Chrome extension the two features I find most compelling, creating and consuming posts, are labeled as "coming soon".</p><p>While not necessarily a feature per se, it has been nice to see <a href="https://twitter.com/thegrid/status/692883150242914304?lang=en">how transparent the team behind the grid has been</a> as they work through getting founding members onto the system and field feedback as their baby leaves the nest. I'm sure this has been especially difficult for them given not all the feedback has been glowing, and not all criticism constructive. Crazy lofty expectations, a lot of buzz, and what some see as a long delay has created frustration. The grid team seems to be taking it in stride while remaining upbeat about long term prospects.</p><h2>Verdict</h2><p>Overall I have to admit I'm somewhat lukewarm to it all. That's not entirely the grid's fault though. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041217220127/http://christopherl.com/">I haven't really had a personal website since sometime in 2004.</a> I'd originally signed up for the grid in the hopes it would serve as a <a href="http://christopherl.com/">more interesting replacement</a> to the largely blank page that sits there now.</p><p>I love the idea that the grid represents. I really hope they're able to deliver on their vision, but they aren't there yet. <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3037187/the-grid-is-building-the-website-of-the-future-it-designs-itself">It isn't the web designer killing automata</a> of the future we've been promised, and there won't be droves of web developers in bread lines, but it is worth checking out if you want a website built by a robot - even if it is one that may not be smart enough to beat you at chess just yet.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="26"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="27"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="28"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="29"><span data-reactid="30"><!-- react-empty: 31 --><h2 data-reactid="32"><a data-reactid="33">christopherl.xyz</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="35"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="36"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="37"></div></section></div></div>
